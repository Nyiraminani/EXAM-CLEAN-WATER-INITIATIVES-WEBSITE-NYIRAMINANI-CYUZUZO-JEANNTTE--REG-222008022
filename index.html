                    <p> Lack of water and sanitation services is especially hard on women and girls.<br> They are often the ones responsible for collecting water, which takes them away from work and school. When they have water, though, all that changes. They have time to work, study, and spend time with their families.</p>

                        <H4>IMPACT ON ECONOMIC PROSPERITY</H4>
                        
                        <p> Spending hours each day fetching water or battling waterborne diseases causes people to lose money on medical costs <br>and lose time they could spend on income-generating activities.<br> When families regain their time and health, they can turn it into education and job opportunities that lead to a better future.

                            <h5>IMPACT ON HEALTH</h5>
                            <p>Without access to clean water, people resort to using and <br>drinking water from contaminated sources, leading to preventable diseases like diarrhea and cholera.<br> These illnesses cause families to lose time and money, and can even lead to death. When communities have a safe water source, <br>they're instead able to thrive. </p>

                                <h5>IMPACT ON EDUCATION</h5>
                                <p>Time lost from fetching water or being sick from waterborne <br>diseases keeps many children out of school. Without kids being able to advance their education, <br>cycles of poverty often continue generation after generation. <br>Once schools and families have water and sanitation facilities and menstrual hygiene resources for girls, <br>children can stay in school and families can prosper. </p>
