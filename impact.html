With over thirty years of experience in nine countries, we've seen how<br>
 access to water fuels health, hope, education, optimism, and prosperity. <br>
 It boosts opportunities for everyone, especially women and girls. <br>
 Children stay in school longer. Fewer people die of illnesses <br>
 caused by contaminated water. Increased education and improved <br>
 health bring economic prosperity to entire regions. Families <br>
 have more time to work, play, and simply spend together.<br>

Our work towards access to water, sanitation, <br>
and hygiene for Everyone Forever changes lives <br>
around the world. Meet the people leading and <br>
experiencing these changes by reading our stories of impact.<br>
