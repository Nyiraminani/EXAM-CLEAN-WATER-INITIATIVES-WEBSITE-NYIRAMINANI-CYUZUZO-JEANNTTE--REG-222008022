                <p> It can be hard to comprehend the impact of clean water and sanitation when <br>
                    you’ve never experienced life without it. But when you’re walking miles each <br>
                    day to fetch water or worrying that the water you do have will make your <br>
                    family sick, the reality is much clearer. Water is life. The communities<br>
                     where Water For People works are passionate about sharing what reliable <br>
                     water and sanitation have done for their schools, their homes, and their lives. <br> </p>

                    <p> Climate change affects water access for people worldwide through more devastating weather events and the<br>

                         is building resilience, planning water resources management, and working <br>
                         with governments on climate financing so that communities and people survive climate change.<br>.</p>

                            without water on site. This impacts every aspect of a young girl's life – education,<br>
                             health, economic opportunity, and safe childbirth. From training women in business<br>
                              and civic leadership to establishing menstrual hygiene centers in schools, Water<br>
                               For People is promoting equity and opportunity.<br>
